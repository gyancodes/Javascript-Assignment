# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that used to make websites more fun and interactive. It lets website creators add things like moving images, clickable buttons, and other features that make websites more interesting and easy to use. JavaScript code is executed by web browsers and can be used for both front-end development (what users see and interact with on a website) and back-end development (server-side operations).

JavaScript was first created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape. Initially, it was called Mocha, but later it was renamed to LiveScript and then to JavaScript. Despite its name, JavaScript has little to do with the Java programming language.

In summary, JavaScript is a programming language that enables developers to add interactivity and dynamic features to websites, making them more engaging and user-friendly.
